								<h3>A Peek Through Me </h3>
								<p>Everything starts in September of 2016, a 18 years old young Juan decide to quit everything, wich was nothing at the same time an travel, a dream he has since he was a kid.
                I decided to sell my beautiful scooter and travel, my first destination was Scotland, but guees what happened when you take your first trip alone and without previous knowledge of what a travel like that was, yup, you guess right, I lost the plane , it was not a good star was it?. Well after a couple hours of complaining I decided to not give up. So I took my laptop and search for another adventure, and here is when Amsterdam comes!, Yup Amsterdam the Dutch Capital, actually untill that point in my life I barely pay attention to them but I love Thai-boxing so after some hours of research I thought that Amsterdam will be my next destination, but here we got another issue, I did no have a house neither work, wich I have in Scotland, but well we live in the digital era so after some hours infront the laptop I found everything that I need to start my trip, thanks to Couchsurfing I found a beautiful house in Haarlem with a gay couple one from Brasil and the other from the Netherlands, Martin and Camilo  <a href="#" class="icon fa-heart"><span class="label"></span></a>, I also found a host in a Christian hostel for 3 weeks in exchange of work, in the Jordan area , after some long hours I booked my flight to the Dutch Capital, Amsterdam it was the 25 of September well actually the 26 when I got Amsterdam, and this is just the  beginning </p>

								<p>Well as I said It was just the beginning after those 3 wonderful weeks I had to leave the hostel wich at that time was very painful, so well I leave the hostel, and I was ready to start my Dutch adventure, I found a job at an Argentine restaurant, and guess what? Nobody was Argentinian funny Eh?, the boss was for Egypt, most of the people there were from Italy, specially the waiters, another from Czech Republic, and a half Turkey half Dutch waitress, I must say that It was a good period in my life and also my very first job! At that time I could not Speak none English so I was pretty alone so I decide to find something to do in my free time and I signed up to a gym, Thai-boxing gym with Lucien Carbin <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>, you might not know him but he is a legend in our little world, very proud to have been his student</p>

								<h4>Second Part</h4>
								<p>After 8 months living in Amsterdam I decided that my time was over and I should move on and keep traveling as I always wanted (also the weather did not help much , Iá¸¿ from Ecuador  <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>) So I planned my next trip, the sunny Portugal, I expend 3 weeks in the sunny Faro and It was awesome, then I went to the Swiss Alps, for another month in a hostel close to the mountains, and awesome experience, I was in France thought but the Alp where in the Swiss part, so yup, I could say I was in two countries at the same time <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i> I keep coding at that time  but just HTML and CSS, and after that I went back home, Spain (Ecuatorian raised in Spain <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>). One day talking with a friend of mine that I made in the Netherlands, he talks me about <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/">Lewagon</a> and they hook me so I decide to Join in the batch #131 in Milan, after the bootcamp I keep traveling , throught Germany,Greece and here I am today two years later I can say that I'm a Junior software developer crazy eh?  </p>

								<p>And well that's me hope you enjoy the story, if you have any suggestion or any question you can write me down at <strong>Juanchuu.jfpc@gmail.com</strong></p>
